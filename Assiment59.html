<h1>Operation: moon pork</h1>
<p>In my game operaation moon pork you play as a farmer on the moon who is is working to pay off his Â£10,000,000 debt to the company that took him to the moon.The core machanices of the game are farming and combat as there are three ways to make money the first being pig farming. This is where the combat asspect of the game comes in as you have to fight the 3 diffrent kind of pigs. there is a normal pig, a mutant pig and a ferel pig. the other way to make money would be to farm crop pigs which is the farming element of the game. This is less dangerous then fighting but will tak longer to do. The third way to make money is through reparing thing around the biodome. This produces lots of money but is not always available. </p>
